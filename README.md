**Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Deepa. Welcome to my journey of turning raw data into actionable knowledge...**


## About Me

I am a highly motivated and ambitious individual with a lifelong passion for data. My background in mathematics, combined with years of testing experience, has cultivated an analytical mindset that helps me identify key dependencies in delivering successful data-driven projects. My exceptional organizational skills and problem-solving abilities enable me to mitigate risks and navigate challenges while meeting tight deadlines, budgets, and objectives. Additionally, my expertise in testing has allowed me to leverage analytical tools such as SQL, SSRS, and Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for effective data manipulation and driving business outcomes.

My passion for data has driven me to enrol in a 12-week intensive Digital Skills Bootcamp in Data with JustIT Training. This program has helped me enhance my data analysis skills and learn new visualization tools, including Tableau, Power BI, MySQL, Python, and R. I‚Äôve applied these skills through several data-driven projects, which I showcase in my GitHub and Tableau Public portfolios.

I am eager to establish myself in a data-related role where I can leverage my experience as a Test Analyst alongside the skills I gained from the bootcamp. My goal is to harness my analytical abilities to drive impactful insights and innovative solutions. I aim to collaborate with cross-functional teams to develop data strategies that enhance decision-making processes and optimize business performance. Additionally, I am keen to deepen my expertise in emerging technologies and data science techniques, such as machine learning and advanced analytics. Ultimately, I aspire to contribute to projects that not only advance organizational goals but also positively influence the broader community, using data to tackle real-world challenges.
